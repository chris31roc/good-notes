#### Title
Note Taker

# Description
An application that allows the user to take notes and create new notes. The application can also save those notes the user created.

# Reason and Problems
Being able to take notes is a tool that should be at everyone's fingertips for any topic or idea. This was an assignment that I needed a lot of help with. My coding friends and my tutors helped me with the application because my original code would not connect to the notes.html file even after I refractered my original code.
